1. I would like to use the NASA API to show the asteroids and where they are relative to earth. 
2. //Sketch will be uploaded seperately
3. I will need to use the API key to gather the info
   Then I will have to utilize that information to make 
   asteroids spawn. I can just use object spawning.
   I could make a prefab and just have that spawn in the
   relative space to the object that is my earth.
   I am not super sure about my API yet and I may need help deciding
   which nuts if information should drive my spawning and the location of those objects.
4. I really want to use the asteroids but, I also am interested in
   using the solar flare data. I could use this to build objects and
   show how far away but yet how powerful these flares have been.
   I could use the particle system in unity and generate flares from the parameters of the data.
5. The API is working well. Here is an example of what it looks like from the browser.

{"date":"2018-12-11","explanation":"Why does this galaxy have such a long tail?   In this stunning vista, based on image data from the Hubble Legacy Archive, distant galaxies form a dramatic backdrop for disrupted spiral galaxy Arp 188, the Tadpole Galaxy. The cosmic tadpole is a mere 420 million light-years distant toward the northern constellation of the Dragon (Draco). Its eye-catching tail is about 280 thousand light-years long and features massive, bright blue star clusters. One story goes that a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front of Arp 188 - from right to left in this view - and was slung around behind the Tadpole by their gravitational attraction. During the close encounter, tidal forces drew out the spiral galaxy's stars, gas, and dust forming the spectacular tail. The intruder galaxy itself, estimated to lie about 300 thousand light-years behind the, can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper right. Following its terrestrial namesake, the Tadpole Galaxy will likely lose its tail as it grows older, the tail's star clusters forming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.

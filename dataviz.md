1. I would like to use the NASA API to show the asteroids and where they are relative to earth. 
2. //Sketch will be uploaded seperately
3. I will need to use the API key to gather the info
   Then I will have to utilize that information to make 
   asteroids spawn. I can just use object spawning.
   I could make a prefab and just have that spawn in the
   relative space to the object that is my earth.
   I am not super sure about my API yet and I may need help deciding
   which nuts if information should drive my spawning and the location of those objects.
4. I really want to use the asteroids but, I also am interested in
   using the solar flare data. I could use this to build objects and
   show how far away but yet how powerful these flares have been.
   I could use the particle system in unity and generate flares from the parameters of the data.

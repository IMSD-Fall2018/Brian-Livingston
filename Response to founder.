This is a very interesting game. It is made almost all 2D. The only thing I think that ia 3D is the begining globe. 
it seems like its a text game with some story board functionality. The tutorial style interuptions are created well.
I feel like a game like this is very sophisticated but, it's not overdone when ut comes to graphics. I wonder why he picked people to be trees.
I feel like that was fone o. purpose but, I just dont know why.
